This archive contains two directories:

1. PASCAL
---------

This is the version of the Pascal tool that was used for the challenge. Pascal is an efficient
tool for computation of gene and pathway scores from GWAS SNP p-values. For further information,
see the README file in the PASCAL directory.


2. Scoring_scripts
------------------

This directory contains scripts that can be used to parse the Pascal output files and compute the
score (total number of significant modules) used for the ranking in the challenge. For further
information, see the README file in the Scoring_scripts directory.
