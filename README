Applying Learning Techniques to the DREAM Challenge.

Commands:
python aggregate.py - finds the scored aggregated clustering of a collection of
np matrices located in data/networks/DSDs, using node lists in data/nodelists,
and gene_ids in data/ids

python dsd.py - computes the DSD matrices and nodelists of a collection of
edgelists located in data/networks/anonymized

python convert.py - converts a directed graph to an undirected graph given a 
filename as a command line parameter

*Note*
FuncAssociate cannot be pip installed and therefore must be installed manually.
Technically, only we have been licensed to use the software, since we had to
request it from the creators, so I would recommend doing the same before using
it.
