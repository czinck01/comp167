This archive contains the original and anonymized versions of the six networks of the
challenge.


DIRECTORIES
-----------

1. anonymized
-------------

The anonymized networks for both sub-challenges as they were provided for the challenge.

2. gene_ids
-----------

Tables mapping anonymized gene IDs to gene symbols for both sub-challenges. For sub-challenge 2,
there is only one file as all networks were anonymized with the same mapping.

3. original
-----------

The original (de-anonymized) networks. These networks are identical to the anonymized versions,
except that the node names are gene symbols instead of anonymized IDs.
